# Phishing Email Detector

A beginner cybersecurity project in Python that checks emails or messages 
for common phishing keywords like urgent, verify, click, free, account, or limited.

## How it works
- Takes user input (an email or message)
- Converts the text to lowercase
- Splits it into words
- Checks each word against suspicious keywords
- Alerts if any suspicious words are found
